Simple Example (Check if a file exists and whether itâ€™s a regular file)

#!/bin/bash

# Simple example: Check if a file exists and if it is a regular file

file="/etc/hosts"  # Define the file path to check

if [ -e "$file" ]; then  # Check if the file exists using the -e test
    echo "$file exists."  # If true, print that the file exists
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then  # Check if the file is a regular file using the -f test
        echo "$file is a regular file."  # If true, print that it is a regular file
    else
        echo "$file is not a regular file."  # If false, print that it's not a regular file
    fi
else
    echo "$file does not exist."  # If the file doesn't exist, print this message
fi  # End of the if-else structure

 Medium Example (Check if a directory exists and if it's writable)
#!/bin/bash

# Medium example: Check if a directory exists and if it is writable

directory="/tmp/my_test_directory"  # Specify the directory to check

if [ -d "$directory" ]; then  # Check if the directory exists using the -d test
    echo "$directory exists."  # If true, print that the directory exists
    if [ -w "$directory" ]; then  # Check if the directory is writable using the -w test
        echo "$directory is writable."  # If true, print that the directory is writable
    else
        echo "$directory is not writable."  # If false, print that it's not writable
    fi
else
    echo "$directory does not exist. Creating it..."  # If the directory doesn't exist, print this message
    mkdir -p "$directory"  # Create the directory using mkdir
    echo "$directory created successfully."  # Print a success message after creating the directory
fi  # End of the if-else structure

Advanced Example (Check if a file is executable and its size)

#!/bin/bash

# Advanced example: Check if a file is executable and if its size is greater than 0 bytes

file="/usr/bin/bash"  # Specify the file to check (an executable binary in this case)

if [ -e "$file" ]; then  # Check if the file exists
    echo "$file exists."  # If true, print that the file exists
    if [ -x "$file" ]; then  # Check if the file is executable using the -x test
        echo "$file is executable."  # If true, print that the file is executable
    else
        echo "$file is not executable."  # If false, print that the file is not executable
    fi

    if [ -s "$file" ]; then  # Check if the file is not empty (greater than 0 bytes) using the -s test
        echo "$file has a size greater than 0 bytes."  # If true, print that the file is not empty
    else
        echo "$file is empty."  # If false, print that the file is empty
    fi
else
    echo "$file does not exist."  # If the file doesn't exist, print this message
fi  # End of the if-else structure
