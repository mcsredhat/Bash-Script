# Bash Scripting Examples

This repository contains a collection of bash scripting examples from basic to advanced levels. These examples demonstrate various bash scripting concepts including conditional statements, functions, variable scoping, and file operations.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several categories:

### If Statement Examples
Contains examples that demonstrate the use of conditional statements in bash:
- Simple examples for checking numeric values
- File existence and attribute checks
- Input validation and processing
- Directory checks and manipulations

### Functions (Basic & Advanced)
Scripts that demonstrate:
- Creating and using functions in bash
- Local and global variable scoping
- Parameter passing to functions
- Array handling in functions
- Return values and exit codes

### Variables & Loops
Examples showing:
- Working with arrays
- Looping through array elements
- Using flags and status tracking
- File modification and configuration

## Example Descriptions

### Simple Examples
- Number value checks (positive, negative, zero)
- File existence and type verification
- Basic command execution

### Medium Examples
- File and directory attribute checking (readable, writable)
- Configuration file modifications
- Error handling and reporting

### Advanced Examples
- User input validation with regex
- Multiple configuration sections management
- DNS configuration file modifications
- Using functions with arrays as parameters

## Usage

Each script is well-commented to explain its purpose and functionality. The scripts can be used as:
- Learning material for bash scripting
- Templates for your own scripts
- Reference for specific bash constructs and patterns

## Common Patterns Demonstrated

- Configuration file manipulation
- Line-by-line file processing
- Error checking and handling
- Function organization and structure
- Script modularization techniques

## Key Techniques

- Using `-e`, `-f`, `-d`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`, `-s` tests for file operations
- Array declaration and iteration
- Function parameter handling
- Local and global variable scope management
- Script organization with main() functions
